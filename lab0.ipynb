    "Now, we will follow this episode of [Coding with Qiskit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93-zLTppFZw&list=PLOFEBzvs-VvrgHZt3exM_NNiNKtZlHvZi&index=4) to guide you through the process of generating a three-qubit GHZ state using [Qiskit patterns](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/intro-to-patterns). \n",
    "\n",
    "A Qiskit pattern is a general framework for breaking down domain-specific problems and contextualizing required capabilities in stages. This allows for the seamless composability of new capabilities developed by IBM Quantum researchers (and others) and enables a future in which quantum computing tasks are performed by powerful heterogenous (CPU/GPU/QPU) computing infrastructure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The four steps of a Qiskit pattern are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Map** problem to quantum circuits and operators\n",
    "2. **Optimize** for target hardware\n",
    "3. **Execute** on target hardware\n",
    "4. **Post-process** results\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 1. Map <a id=\"map\"></a>\n",

    "The Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state is the extension to three (or more) qubits to the maximally entangled state characteristic of the Bell state depicted above. That means that the GHZ state is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|GHZ\\rangle = \\frac{|000\\rangle+|111\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n",
    "$$\n",

    "One of the interesting features of the GHZ state is that there are different and equivalent ways to build it using a quantum circuit. In Exercise 1 you will do it in one of the most common ways."

For example, when running circuits on quantum hardware, you might find connectivity constraints between qubits. This means that some qubits may not be physically connected, so you will need to think of a smart way to implement gates that produce the desired quantum state. Luckily for us, this is where the Qiskit pass manager comes to the rescue! You can provide the desired circuit along with the device's constraints to the pass manager and it will transpile the circuit and handle the optimization for you.\n",
