    "Shor's algorithm, developed by Peter Shor in 1994, is a revolutionary quantum algorithm aimed at efficiently factoring large composite numbers into their prime factors. This task is highly resource-intensive for classical computers and underlies many encryption methods. Leveraging the parallelism inherent in quantum computers, Shor's algorithm utilizes operations like the Quantum Fourier Transform to rapidly factorize numbers. By checking the greatest common divisor of randomly selected numbers and determining the period of a modular function using quantum techniques, the algorithm can deduce the prime factors. Its successful factorization of numbers with exponential speedup over classical methods underscored the potential of quantum computers and raised significant interest in quantum computing's impact on cryptography and security.\n",
